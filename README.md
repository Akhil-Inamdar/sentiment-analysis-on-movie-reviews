# sentiment-analysis-on-movie-reviews
This project builds a machine learning model that can automatically classify movie reviews as Positive or Negative. The system is trained using supervised learning techniques like Logistic Regression and TF-IDF vectorization, and deployed with a Streamlit web interface.

# Project Features
1.Cleans and preprocesses raw movie review text
2.Trains a sentiment classification model (Logistic Regression)
3.Evaluates model performance using accuracy and F1-score
4.Provides a web app to test the model interactively
5.Modular structure for easy extension and reuse
